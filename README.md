Project 1
|--------------------------------------|
  This project was the first I 
  made for my Java class. It reads 
  in a matrix from file and will then
  find the Norm, transpose and write 
  that to file, untranspose and display 
  the matrix.

Project 2
|--------------------------------------|
  This project will take in a polynomial
  and we need to derive that expression
